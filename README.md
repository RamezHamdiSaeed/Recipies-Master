a 3D game do demonstrate the basics and advanced topics about unity like games networking (multiplayer)

- Setup URP with some configs volume effects .
- Add player controller with separation from visual game object . 
- Add our player visual 3d model with dynamic rotation .
- Add idle and walk animations .

- Setup Cinemachine to be above the main camera to ad noise .
- Setup medern input system package parallel with the legacy one to do game prototying and production level development .
- Make the player collide with other collider objects and how to make the player avoid the collider when the game attempt to move diagonally by make him move horizontally or vertically only .
- How to interact with specific game objects using layers not tags and how to deal with each of them separately .
